# Urutau

My son loves listening to bedtime stories. We have a player with some recorded stories but he always ask for one story from my imagination. I'm not that creative to create stories, so that was the sparkle of this project.

This is a bedtime stories generator that uses AI for:

- generating the story with llms
- generating the audio with tts
- generating the cover image

All stories, audio and images are kept in a database, so I can read and play it again, again, and again...

Why Urutau? It is bird that sings at night.
